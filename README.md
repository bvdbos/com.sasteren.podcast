plays podcasts in Homey Media

Saving podcasts in settings is tricky. Add podcasts, then add a new line and delete that line. That triggers a save-action.

## to do:
<br><strike>1) https doesn't work :(</strike>
<br><strike>2) why the &^%%$ doesn't saving work?</strike>
<br><strike>3) texts for settings</strike>
4) verify urls
5) lots of error-chekings
6) rewrite item-title with date
7) use self-given item-name
8) triggers
9) action cards
10) voice commands
11) allow https

v0.1.4 (10-10-17) : no https allowed and fixed saving

v0.1.3 (10-10-17) : use promises

v0.1.1 (9-10-17) : no app-restart needed for reloading podcasts in Media-view, texts for settings added

v0.1.0 (8-10-17) : first version
