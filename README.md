# Podcast-media
plays podcasts in Homey Media

Saving podcasts in settings is tricky. Add podcasts, then add a new line and delete that line. That triggers a save-action.

## to do:
1) https doesn't work :(
2) why the &^%%$ doesn't saving work?
<strike>3) texts for settings</strike>
4) verify urls
5) lots of error-chekings
6) rewrite item-title with date
7) use self-given item-name
8) triggers
9) action cards
10) voice commands
